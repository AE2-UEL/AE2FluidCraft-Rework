# AE2 Fluid Crafting Rework

[![Downloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_623955_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-fluid-crafting-rework) ![MCVsrsion](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/623955.svg)

Put fluids in the pattern!

AE2 autocrafting is amazing and everyone loves it, but it is always becoming painful when dealing with fluids. You have to put fluids in a container or use a dummy item to write patterns with fluids.

That's because AE2 doesn't support fluid as valid crafting ingredients before 1.16, so it can't handle fluids directly.

However, it is changed now! With **AE2 Fluid Crafting** you can write patterns with fluids freely. Your AE system can output and accept fluids like items without worrying about how to handle these fluid cells.

This is a rework and ported version of [ae2-fluid-crafting](https://github.com/phantamanta44/ae2-fluid-crafting)

## Features

 - You can code fluid patterns on fluid terminal directly.
 - Mult/Div/Add/Sub Button also works on fluid.
 - An extended fluid terminal with 16 inputs and 4 outputs.
 - You can add or decrease fluid's amount by clicking with container.
 - Fluid Pattern can display its contents when put on pattern terminal.
 - [1.12.2] Fix the fluid amount display error when removing fluid.
 - [1.12.2] Upgrade cards can be inserted in Dual Interface.
 - [1.12.2] Fluid pattern is searchable in interface terminal.
 - [1.12.2] Fix crash when using block mode, fluid will also be considered as blockable.
 - [1.12.2] Fluid export bus supports crafting card.
